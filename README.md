This is the web application that myself and three other people, Mary Potempa, Ian Roberts, and Robby Goldberg, created for our Informatics Capstone project at Indiana University. The goal of our web application was to provide users with a way to discover activities and events that are going on around them, and allow them to plan to do the activities with their friends if desired.
